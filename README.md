# Shortest Path Finder
### Live Demo: https://shortestroutefinder.netlify.app/

**About**
- This project allows users to create and connect codes on a canvas and find the shortest path between two points.
- The algorithms used to find the shortest path and all the possible paths include BFS and recursive DFS.

**Instructions**
- To add a point/city, type in the name of the point/city in the text box, and click on the map to create it.
- To see a sample city map with points connected, click the buttons Los Angeles and Sacramento.
- To see the shortest path between two points/cities, put the cities' names into the text boxes below "Find path" and click "Find shortest path"
- If the user wants to see all other paths also, it can be pressed by clicking "Show all Paths".
