**About**
- This project calculates the shortest path between two points created on the map that may have many points connected to each other.
- To add a point/city, type in the name of the point/city in the text box, and click the map.
- To see a sample city map with points connected, click the buttons Los Angeles and Sacramento
- To see the shortest path between two points/cities, put the cities name into the text boxes below "Find path" and click "Find shortest path"
- If the user wants to see all other paths also, it can be pressed by clicking "Show all Paths".

**Algorithm**
- The algorithm to find the shortest path here was using recursion and keeping track of all of the cities (nodes) visited.
